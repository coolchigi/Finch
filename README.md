## Finch
Finch, a blend of ‘Financial’ and ‘Inch’, symbolizes the journey of making small but steady strides towards your financial goals.

This application is designed with a simple aim - to help you keep track of your financial goals. As a fourth-year computer science student, I realized that while banking apps do a great job of displaying recent transactions, they often lack a dedicated feature to monitor income and expenses without linking to the banking app. This realization led to the creation of Finch.

Finch is not about promising an array of features that are hard to deliver. Instead, it’s about providing a practical solution to a common problem. It’s about giving you a tool that allows you to easily track your financial activities, helping you gain a better understanding of your income and expenses.

This idea resonated with several individuals I spoke with, indicating a shared need for such a solution. So, whether you’re tired of manually tracking your finances or just looking for a simpler way to stay on top of your financial game, Finch is here to help.

Remember, the journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step, or in our case, a single ‘Finch’! 🐦
